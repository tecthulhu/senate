# Senate

AI governance framework — laws, project management, and development lifecycle for constituent projects.

## Install

Open Claude Code, Codex, or any AI coding agent in your project directory and paste:

```
Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kescott027/senate/main/bootstrap/initiator.md and execute the instructions in it. This is the project directory.
```

The AI will detect your environment (new repo, existing codebase, or empty directory), download the governance framework, and walk you through setup.

> **No AI web access?** Run `curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kescott027/senate/main/bootstrap/initiator.md` and paste the output to your AI with: "Execute the instructions in this document. This is the project directory."

## How It Works

Laws govern how constituent projects operate. The legislative lifecycle is:

1. A constituent **proposes a bill** via GitHub Issue
2. The bill is **triaged** and enters a **review period**
3. Constituents **vote** on the bill
4. Passed bills enter a **48-hour executive review** window
5. If not vetoed, the law is **enacted** and added to the codebase

The executive (`kescott027`) can also enact, repeal, veto, suspend, or amend any law at any time without vote.

## Proposing a Bill

To propose a new law, amendment, or repeal, open a GitHub Issue using the appropriate template:

- [New Law](../../issues/new?template=BILL_NEW_LAW.yml) -- Propose a new LAW-NNN
- [Amendment](../../issues/new?template=BILL_AMENDMENT.yml) -- Propose changes to an existing law
- [Repeal](../../issues/new?template=BILL_REPEAL.yml) -- Propose removing an existing law
- [Feedback](../../issues/new?template=FEEDBACK.yml) -- Provide feedback on laws or process

See `docs/governance/contributor_guide.md` for the full proposal and voting guide.

## Syncing

Constituent projects sync with the senate at each sprint start. See [sync/README.md](sync/README.md) for the full protocol and [templates/sprint-sync-checklist.md](templates/sprint-sync-checklist.md) for a ready-to-use checklist.

## Seed Laws

The senate was founded with 13 seed laws (LAW-000 through LAW-012) covering:

| Law | Topic |
|-----|-------|
| LAW-000 | Operating Principles |
| LAW-001 | Planning Rules |
| LAW-002 | Backlog Format |
| LAW-003 | Engineering Standards |
| LAW-004 | Security Standards |
| LAW-005 | Testing Standards |
| LAW-006 | Release Standards |
| LAW-007 | Observability Standards |
| LAW-008 | Review Cadence |
| LAW-009 | AI Workflows |
| LAW-010 | Continuous Improvement |
| LAW-011 | Blocker Management |
| LAW-012 | Bill Submission Process |

## Bootstrapping New Projects

The senate provides a complete bootstrapping framework for bringing projects under governance:

- [**BOOTSTRAP.md**](BOOTSTRAP.md) -- Template for project owners to define vision, architecture, deliverables, and backlog
- [**project_management_bootstrapping.md**](project_management_bootstrapping.md) -- AI execution guide for **new projects** (empty or near-empty repos)
- [**project_management_bootstrapping_existing.md**](project_management_bootstrapping_existing.md) -- AI execution guide for **existing projects** (repos with code, history, and in-flight work)
- [**project_management_skeleton/**](project_management_skeleton/) -- Clean template files for `.project_management/`

### Which guide to use?

| Situation | Guide |
|-----------|-------|
| Brand new repo, no code yet | `project_management_bootstrapping.md` |
| Existing repo with code and history | `project_management_bootstrapping_existing.md` |
| Existing `.project_management/` needs senate integration | See "Governance Upgrade Path" appendix in the existing project guide |
